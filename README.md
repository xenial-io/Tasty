# Tasty - Delicious dotnet testing

Tasty is a [.NET library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xenial.Tasty) that runs delicious dotnet tests and is inspired by [jest](http://jestjs.io/), [bullseye](https://github.com/adamralph/bullseye) and [simple-exec](https://github.com/adamralph/simple-exec).

Tasty can do anything. It's not restricted to be a testing framework.

Platform support: [.NET Standard 2.0 and upwards, including net462](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).

- [Documentation](https://tasty.xenial.io)
- [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xenial.Tasty/)

## Quick start

### 1. Create a normal console application

Tasty doesn't have any strong opinion in which context you are running tests from. For this tutorial we are going to start with a simple console application:

```cmd
dotnet new console -o MyFirstTastyTests && cd MyFirstTastyTests
```

### 2. Install the nuget package

Tasty is a micro framework, so think of it more as a library than a whole framework. In order to use Tasty we need to add the nuget package:

```cmd
dotnet add package Xenial.Tasty
```

### 3. Add the using statement

Tasty uses the C#6 syntax to reduce clutter when writing tests, so we need to add a static using import to use it:

```cs
using System;

using static Xenial.Tasty; //This will import all the static methods into the current namespace

namespace MyFirstTastyTests
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Write your first test case

Tasty is a *functional* inspired testing *micro framework* that uses the latest C# features like Tuples and inline functions to increase test readability and provide richer error messages for better UX when troubleshooting failing tests. So let's add a simple calculation test:

```cs
using System;

using static Xenial.Tasty;

namespace MyFirstTastyTests
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //This will tell Tasty that there is an test case named '1 + 2 should be 3'
            It("1 + 2 should be 3", () =>
            {
                var calculation = 1 + 2; // Act
                var isThree = calculation == 3; // Assert

                //Tell Tasty the result by returning a Tuple with additional information
                return (isThree, $"1 + 2 should be 3 but actually was {calculation}");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Add the run method

Because Tasty is a *micro framework*. That means it does nothing until you tell it to do so. So let's add the `Run` method and tell it to execute the tests:

```cs
using System;

using static Xenial.Tasty;

namespace MyFirstTastyTests
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            It("1 + 2 should be 3", () =>
            {
                var calculation = 1 + 2;
                var isThree = calculation == 3;
                return (isThree, $"1 + 2 should be 3 but actually was {calculation}");
            });

            Run(args); //Tell Tasty to execute the test cases
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Run the project and see the results

Cause it's a normal console application, we just can run it with the known dotnet commands you already know, so let's execute the project:

```cmd
dotnet run
```

We should get an output similar to this:

```txt
👍 [00:00:00.0042]  1 + 2 should be 3

=================================================================================================
Summary:              F0 |              I0 |             NR0 |              S1 | T1
Time:    [00:00:00.0000] | [00:00:00.0000] | [00:00:00.0000] | [00:00:00.0042] | [00:00:00.0042]
Outcome:         Success
=================================================================================================
```

## Contribute

### Prerequisites

You need to have [node v12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [dotnet sdk 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your local machine.

### Commitizen

We use node only for linting commit messages and pushes so make sure to install the proper hooks by running:

```cmd
npm install
```

Afterwards you are able to commit code either by hand using the [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) rules or by running:

```cmd
git cz
//OR
npm run c
```  

### Building

You should be able to build the project by using the build scripts:

```cmd
#Windows
build.bat
#Or for short
b.bat
#Or for powershell
./build.ps1

#Linux & MacOS
. build.sh
```

The project uses [bullseye](https://github.com/adamralph/bullseye) to list individual targets use `build -l`.

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses `dotnet format` to keep the code base consistent. If the build fails, you can use `build format` to automatically format code against the rules defined.

### Bypass checks

By default when you commit the message is linted and before you push changes a default integration build is started. To bypass this behavior you can add `--no-verify` to the `git commit` or `git push` commands.

### Writing docs

We use [Wyam](https://wyam.io/) to write the documentation. To serve up docs simply call `b docs.serve` and open `http://localhost:5080/`. All documentation is in the `docs` directory.
